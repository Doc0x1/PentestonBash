# PentestonBash
This is a Bash plugin designed to simplify the process of ethical pentesting, particularly in the context of TryHackMe (and other) CTFs. 

This plugin provides a convenient way to manage your LHOST (local host) and RHOST (remote host) environment variables, making them persistent across your bash shells.

## What Does This Plugin Do?
This script sets persistent environment variables for LHOST and RHOST, which are essential for ethical pentesting. These variables are stored in your .bashrc file, ensuring they are available in all your bash shells.

## Getting Started
To begin using PentestonBash, follow these steps:
1. Open a terminal as a regular user (or root user, if that's the user you normally use).
2. Clone the repository and run the setup script:
```
git clone https://github.com/Doc0x1/PentestonBash.git
cd ./PentestonBash
chmod +x ./setup.sh
bash ./setup.sh
```

## Commands and Usage
PentestonBash provides the following commands:
- `penteston` - Enables the feature and sets the RHOST and LHOST environment variables in your .bashrc file
  - **--help** - Displays helpful information for using the `penteston` command
  - **--lhost** - Specifies the local host IP address (usually your **tun0** IP address when connected to **TryHackMe's VPN**)
  - **--rhost** - Specifies the remote host IP address (the target machine for the **TryHackMe Room** you are doing)
- `pentestoff` - Disables the feature and removes the RHOST and LHOST environment variables from your .bashrc file

## Testing the Setup
To ensure the script is working properly, you can check the values of the RHOST and LHOST environment variables after running the `penteston` command. If the outputs correspond to the values you entered when using the `penteston` command, then the setup is successful. You can use the `pentestoff` command at any time to turn off the Pentesting Environment.

## Important Note
Remember to use the `pentestoff` command when you are done with the pentest. This command unsets the LHOST and RHOST variables and removes them from your .bashrc file.

## Final Words
We hope you find PentestonBash useful in your ethical pentesting endeavors. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to reach out. Happy pentesting!
