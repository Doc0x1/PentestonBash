# PentestonBash
A Bash plugin to make doing TryHackMe CTFs easier while in the terminal.

# WARNING BEFORE USE
- **I am NOT liable if anything included in this repository breaks, bricks, ruins, or otherwise harms your Linux system.**
- **Anything you do, or decide to do, with the code I've provided in this repository is NOT my problem.**

## What This Plugin Does
This script will make it so that you have **LHOST** (local host) and **RHOST** (remote host) environment variables peristent across your bash shells.

## Setup
Open up a terminal as a regular user (or root user, if that's the user you normally use) and use the following to set the plugin up:
```
git clone https://github.com/Doc0x1/PentestonBash.git
cd ./PentestonBash
chmod +x ./setup.sh
bash ./setup.sh
```

## Commands and Usage
- `penteston --lhost <10.10.10.10> --rhost <10.10.10.20>` (example IPs used)
  - **--lhost** will (usually) be your **tun0** IP address when you are connected to **TryHackMe's VPN**
  - **--rhost** will be the IP address of the target machine for whatever **TryHackMe Room** you are doing
- `pentestoff` - Turns off the feature and removes the RHOST and LHOST environment variables from your .bashrc file

## Testing to make sure it's working properly
To test to ensure the script is working properly, after running the `penteston` command as described above, you can do the following:
```
> echo $RHOST
10.10.10.10

> echo $LHOST
10.10.10.20
```
If you notice the outputs correspond to what you entered when you used the `penteston` command **(underneath Commands and Usage)** then you have it working. Use `pentestoff` at any time to turn the Pentesting Environment off.
